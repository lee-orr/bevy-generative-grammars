# About
This is a library for handling generative grammars in bevy.

At the moment, I'm starting with simple grammars - the first one is [Tracery](https://github.com/galaxykate/tracery), which is primarily useful for strings.

However, I intend to add some other structures, to open the door for more complex options such as geometry grammars and graph grammars.
